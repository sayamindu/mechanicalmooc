Greetings Creative Learners,
</p>

<p>
Welcome to Learning Creative Learning, a Mechanical Massive Open Online Course. This course is built around live seminars held at the MIT Media Lab and hands-on activities that participants work on throughout the week.
  
All materials will remain online and are openly licensed, so don't worry if you fall behind at any point. Let the over-achievers be over-achievers. 

  
  
We built a machine that coordinates emails. 
  
  is created by the Mechanical MOOC out of existing, openly available educational resources across the web, including course materials from MIT, study groups from OpenStudy, and exercises from Codecademy.  P2PU has built the machine that powers the experience and can connect you to a small group of peers.
</p>

<p>
The next round of the course begins November 26, 2012. You should expect to begin receiving e-mails preparing you for the course in the last week of mid-November. If youâ€™re signing up near the start of the course, you can access a full archive of e-mails for the course at <a href="http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/category/seq26nov12/">http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/category/seq26nov12/</a>
</p>

<p>
The Mechanical MOOC reminds you there is no course instructor on this journey--you and your peers will rely on each other to understand the content and figure out the difficult concepts.  We believe we've assembled some of the best tools out there for learning independently and connecting with a large support group, but the energy that will power the course comes from you.
</p>

<p>
Rest up, and prepare to learn Python!
</p>

<p>
Your one and only,
  
  Lego Clown
