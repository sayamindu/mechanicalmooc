Greetings Creative Learners,

Welcome to the online version of "Learning Creative Learning", a course on designing technologies and environments for creative learning. What do we mean by <i>creative learning</i>, you ask? We'll cover that in the course as well. This program is brought to you through a collaboration between the MIT Media Lab and Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU).

What's going to happen next?

The course starts on Feb 11th. A few days before we will send you an email with further information on how to get started. We will also group you with other folks (if you used a group token, you already know all about that) and get group introductions kicked off.

And once the course starts?

It's a combination of readings, reflection, discussion and hands-on activities. We will also have weekly panel conversations with invited experts. All the content and videos will remain online and everything is openly licensed, so don't worry if you want to go a little slower than the rest at any point. This isn't aobut making it to the finish line first. But more on all this later...

Who is sending this email?

It's the Machine (a piece of software actually). It is good at creating lots of small groups and sending emails to them. The emails are written by us. The machine sends them to you. The machine doesn't have a name yet and we are open to suggestions.

Over to you...

We will provide the course structure, but there is no facilitator or instructor in each of your groups. You and your peers will rely on each other to discuss the content, and help each other. We'll certainly help as much as we can, but the energy that will power this course comes from you!

Now get some rest before we kick off. We look forward to seeing you in the course! Cheerio!

Your Learning Creative Learning Team (Mitch, Natalie, Ricarose, Sayamindu, Klaudia, Elizabeth & Philipp)
