	<p>Learning Creative Learning is a course offered at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>. It introduces ideas and strategies for designing technologies to support creative learning. 

      <p>This semester, for the first time, <a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a> and the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">Media Lab</a> are working together to bring the course online. We are <b>opening up the seminars, course materials, and hands-on activities</b> to anyone with a computer and Internet access. It's a big experiment, we expect to learn a lot, and we hope you'll enjoy it.</p>

       	<h2>How is this going to work? What will I be learning and doing?</h2>

	<p>You learn a whole lot about learning. And because learning is more fun with other people we invited some of the best thinkers and builders in this space to join our conversations. Each week we have a relatively informal panel conversation that looks ata specific topoc (e.g. "Making" or "Tinkering"). We'll suggest some readings and prompt you to reflect on the topic and apply it to your own interests. And finally, we designed an activity for each week, that students can tackle on their own or in groups (more fun!). 
      
      To summarize, we will look at different learning technologies, discuss educational concepts like interest-based learning and learning through tinkering, examine and develop design principles, and create new prototypes and applications. And you'll get a chance to experiment with lots of different projects - many of which were developed in the Lifelong Kindergarten group right here at the Lab.</p>
          
       <h2>Who are you people? Who created this course?</h2>

	<p>Learning Creative Learning is offered by Mitch Resnick, who is the director of Lifelong Kindergarten and the LEGO Papert Professor at the MIT Media Lab. He has been a pioneer in technology & learning for a looooooong time. And has built such wonderful things as <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, the <a href="http://www.computerclubhouse.org/">Computer Clubhouse</a>, and <a href="http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects.php?id=135">Programmable Bricks</a>, a collaboration with the LEGO Company. More about Mitch is <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/">here</a>.</p>

	<p>For this course Mitch has been working closely with Natalie Rusk, a Research Scientist in the Lifelong Kindergarten group, and Philipp Schmidt, Executive Director of P2PU and a MIT Media Lab Director's Fellow. Natalie is a specialist in motivation for learning. Philipp is interested in creating better ways for people to learn with each other online.</p>

       <h2>An online experiment, learning by the seats of our pants ... with you!</h2>

          <p>What you are looking at here is a <b>BIG</b> experiment. For the first time, we are opening the course to online participants. In the spirit of learning and technology, we hope that participants will jump in as collaborators rather than passive recipients. We want to tinker together. Things will break, but we are committed to fixing them along the way. We invite you to break and fix them together with us.</p>
          
		<h2>Open critique</h2>

          <p>One of the big challenges of online learning is to scale the expert. In the studio model of learning, which is pretty much how things work at the Media Lab, more experienced students and faculty will review and critique your work. That is hard to move online. But we'll try. As part of the course, we will organize a studio review session in which Mitch and Natalie will invite some of the online students to present and discuss their work and give them feedback.</p>

          <h2>Check out our shiny new platform</h2>

          <p>Actually, don’t, because we didn’t build a shiny new platform. Our platform is the web and we like things distributed and open. We also wanted to create a model that is easy to replicate for anyone, which influenced our choice of technology. We use off-the-shelf Google+ features, like Hangouts and Google+ communities; and open source software like the Mechanical MOOC (github). You have no excuse not to build a course like this yourself!</p>
