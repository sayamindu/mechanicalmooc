		<p>Learning Creative Learning<i> is a course offered at the MIT Media Lab. It introduces ideas and strategies for designing technologies to support creative learning. We have invited some of the best thinkers and builders in this space to join our conversations and you'll get a chance to experiment with lots of different projects - many of which were developed in the Lifelong Kindergarten group right here at the Lab.</p>

		<p>The course is offered by Mitch Resnick, who is the director of Lifelong Kindergarten and the LEGO Papert Professor at the MIT Media Lab. He has been a pioneer in technology & learning for a looooooong time. And has built such wonderful things as Scratch, the Computer Clubhouse, and Programmable Bricks, a collaboration with the LEGO Company. More about Mitch is here -> http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/</p>

		<p>Working with Mitch are Natalie Rusk, a Research Scientist in the Lifelong Kindergarten group, and Philipp Schmidt, Executive Director of P2PU and a MIT Media Lab Director's Fellow. Natalie is a specialist for motivation .... Philipp is interested in how people learn as peers online.</p>

          <p><b>What will you be learning?</b></p>

          <p>Participants in this course will analyze learning technologies, discuss educational concepts like interest-based learning and learning through tinkering, examine and develop design principles, and create new prototypes and applications.</p>

          <p><b>Say what?</b></p>

          <p>There will be weekly readings, reflection and discussion, and project-based activities. We decided not to focus on a big course-project, but participants are encouraged to go deeper on any of the weekly activities they find particularly interesting.</p>

          <p><b>An online experiment, learning by the seats of our pants</b></p>

          <p>What you are looking at here is a BIG experiment. This semester, for the first time, we will open the course to online participants. In the spirit of the course, we hope that participants will jump in as collaborators rather than passive recipients of information. We want to tinker together. Things will break, but we are committed to fixing them along the way and invite you to break things and fix them together with us.</p> 

          <p><b>Look at our shiny new platform</b></p>

          <p>Actually, don’t, because we didn’t build a shiny new platform. Our platform is the web and we like things distributed and open. We also wanted to create a model that is easy to replicate for anyone, which influenced our choice of technology. We use off-the-shelf Google+ features, like Hangouts and Google+ communities; and open source software like the Mechanical MOOC (github). You have no excuse not to build a course like this yourself!</p>

          <p><b>Open critique</b></p>

          <p>We will provide online participants access to course materials, including videos of portions of the course (both live-streamed and archived), and with opportunities to participate in online discussions around course readings and activities. Online participants will not receive any credit or credential for their participation, and they will not receive regular feedback or evaluation from the course staff. But we are planning an open critique session, during which Mitch Resnick and Natalie Rusk will review the work of some online students and give feedback and suggestions.</p>
