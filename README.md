# Learning Creative Learning / Mechanical MOOC

Learning Creative Learning is a course offered at the MIT Media Lab. This is the first time we are providing an online version, using the Mechanical MOOC and G+ communities.

The Mechanical MOOC is P2PU's light-weight open source platform for orchestrating large-scale online courses. Currently it contains:

 * A simple webserver and splash page
 * A form to get people signed up for a course
 * A grouping script to create email groups of learners (using mailgun's mailing lists)
 * A group confirmation step (click here to confirm you would like to be in a group)
 * An WYSIWYG email editor for sending emails with tags
 * A Logging setup to get logs from mailgun
 * Supports multiple rounds of a course
